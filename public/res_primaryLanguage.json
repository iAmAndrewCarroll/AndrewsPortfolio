      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm iAmAndrewCarroll. A gifted improvisational speaker, communication & relationship artist, coach, poet, and vocalist.  My favorite things to do include ecstatic dance, movement of any kind, weight lifting, snowboarding, longboarding, getting outside in the dirt, camping, hiking, and water.  Constantly working to better myself mentally, emotionally, spiritually, physically, and financially I have a deep appreciation and focus on productive and unstructured play as a means of increasing overall productivity and effectiveness.  My measure of success is holding firm to my personal code of conduct, engaging in things that bring me joy, and eliminating anything that does not fulfill me.  I am always a valuable addition to any team I choose to join and look forward to making many new connections on the journey that is life.. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
